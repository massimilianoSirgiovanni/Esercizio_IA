THE PROGRAM IS UNDER THE FORM OF A SIMPLE JAVA PROJECT.
TO ACCESS THE PROJECT YOU CAN USE THE METHOD THAT YOU PREFER. USE OF THE ECLIPSE IDE IS RECOMMENDED.
TO ACCESS THE PROJECT THROUGH ECLIPSE IS SUFFICIENT TO FOLLOW THE FOLLOWING STEPS:
 
 > DOWNLOAD THE ZIP FILE IN THE GITHUB REPOSITORY "https://github.com/massimilianoSirgiovanni/Esercizio_IA"
 > OPEN ECLIPSE
 > SELECT THE REQUIRED PATH FOR THE WORKSPACE
 > ONCE INSIDE THE WORKSPACE, RIGHT-CLICK THE MOUSE BUTTON ON THE EXPLORER PACKAGE
 > CLICK ON IMPORT
 > A WINDOW WILL OPEN, SELECT IN THE GENERAL FOLDER THE ITEM "Existing projects into Workspace" AND CLICK "Next>"
 > SELECT THE ITEM "Select archive file" AND SELECT THE "AI_Exercise" COMPRESSED FOLDER, ATTACHED TOGETHER WITH THIS FILE
 > NOW THAT THE PROJECT FOLDER IS CONTAINED IN THE EXPLORER PACKAGE, JUST EXPAND THE FOLDER, EXPAND SRC AND THE CODES ARE FOUND WITHIN THE VARIOUS PACKAGES
 > PER ESEGUIRE L'ESEMPIO RICHIESTO, SULLA COLORAZIONE DELL'AUSTRALIA, BASTA ACCEDERE AL PACCHETTO CSP, NEL QUALE SI TROVERÃ  LA CLASSE MAIN
 > TO PERFORM THE REQUIRED EXAMPLE, ON THE COLORING OF AUSTRALIA, JUST ACCESS THE CSP PACKAGE, IN WHICH YOU WILL FIND THE "MAIN" CLASS
 > TO RUN IT, YOU JUST PRESS THE RIGHT BUTTON OF THE MOUSE, GET TO THE "Run as" SUBMENU AND CLICK ON "Java Applicaton"

THE SAME EXAMPLE PRESENT IN THE BOOK HAS BEEN RECREATED IN THE "MAIN" CLASS. 

HOWEVER IT IS POSSIBLE TO CHANGE THE GRAPH OF THE CONSTRAINTS.

MAKE YOUR OWN CSP:

TO CREATE A GRAPH IT IS SUFFICIENT TO CREATE A GRAPH-CLASS OBJECT --> Graph graphName = new Graph();

TO ADD A NODE IT IS SUFFICIENT TO CREATE AN OBJECT OF THE "NODE" CLASS IN THIS WAY:

	Node nodeName = new Node("nodeName", domain);

TO ADD THE NODE TO A GRAPH YOU CAN USE THE "addNode(Node node)" FUNCTION

	graphName.addNode(nodeName);

A NODE CAN BE REMOVED USING THE "remove(Node node)" FUNCTION

	graphName.removeNode(nodeName)

AN ARCH CAN BE CREATED AND DELETED RESPECTIVELY IN THIS WAY:
	
	graphName.addLink(nodeName1, nodeName2);
	
	graphName.removeLink(nodeName1, nodeName2);

THE GRAPH AND A DOMAIN, PROPERLY CREATED, MUST BE PASSED TO THE "CSP" CLASS OBJECT TO CREATE A CSP

FOR THE REALIZATION OF THIS CODE, TWO FUNCTIONS HAVE BEEN TAKEN AS REFERENCE, WRITTEN THROUGH PSEUDOCODE.
THE TWO FUNCTIONS ARE ON THE BOOK "Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig. Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach. 3rd edition. Pearson, 2010"

THESE FUNCTIONS ARE:

	> BACKTRACKING-SEARCH (it is found on page 215 of the aforementioned book)
	> MIN-CONFLICTS (it is found on page 221 of the aforementioned book)
